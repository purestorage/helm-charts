# PureStorage Helm Charts and PSO Operator

# Installation of PSO Operator
Follow instructions in the [operator.](./operator/README.md#overview)


# Installation for Helm Chart

## Adding the `pure` repo

```bash
helm repo add pure https://purestorage.github.io/helm-charts
helm repo update
```

## Helm Setup
Please ensure you have a correct service account with cluster-admin role in K8s/Openshift for Helm. 

Install the helm by following the official documents:
1. For Kubernetes
https://docs.helm.sh/using_helm#install-helm

2. For Openshift 
https://blog.openshift.com/getting-started-helm-openshift/
**Starting OpenShift 3.11 the preferred installation method is using the PSO Operator. Follow the instructions in the [operator directory](./operator/README.md).**

In order to enable helm tiller to install any type of services across the entire cluster, it's required to grant helm tiller with cluster admin role.

After helm installation, configure the cluster admin role for the service account of the helm tiller. You need to figure out the correct service account.
```bash
# For K8s, for exmaple of a service account {TILLER_NAMESPACE}:default
kubectl create clusterrolebinding add-on-cluster-admin --clusterrole=cluster-admin --serviceaccount=${TILLER_NAMESPACE}:default

# For Openshift version < 3.11:
oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user cluster-admin system:serviceaccount:${TILLER_NAMESPACE}:tiller
```

For more details, please see https://docs.helm.sh/using_helm/

# Updating Charts
We serve charts using a github page with its root at [./docs](./docs) when the helm source is updated
we need to do something like:

```bash
helm package ./$CHART_NAME
cp $CHART_NAME.tgz ./docs
helm repo index docs --url https://purestorage.github.io/helm-charts
```

Luckily there is a helper script to make this easy:

```bash
./update.sh
```

You can then commit the changes and have them become available once merged.
