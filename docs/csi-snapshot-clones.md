# Using CSI Snapshots and Clones with Kubernetes

## Introduction

The Pure Service Orchestrator Kubernetes CSI driver includes support for snapshots and clones. These features allow Kubernetes end users to capture point-in-time copies of their persistent volume claims, and mount those copies in other Kubernetes Pods, or recover from a snapshot. This enables several use cases, some of which include :

1. Test / Develop against copies of production data quickly (no need to copy large amounts of data)
2. Backup / Restore production volumes.

These features use native Kubernetes APIs to call the feature-set in the underlying storage backend. Currently, only the FlashArray backend can fully support snapshots and clones.

## Dependencies

The following dependencies must be true before the snapshot and clone functionality can be used:

* Kubernetes already running, deployed, configured, etc
* PSO correctly installed and using [Pure CSI Driver v5.0.5](https://github.com/purestorage/helm-charts/releases/tag/5.0.5)+.
* For the snapshot feature, ensure you have Kubernetes 1.13+ installed and the `VolumeSnapshotDataSource` feature gate is enabled. This featuregate is set to `True` by default from 1.17 and therefore does not need to be set from this version onwards.
* For the clone feature, ensure you have Kubernetes 1.15+ installed and the `VolumePVCDataSource` feature gate is enabled. This feature graduated to GA in 1.18 and is therefore no longer required in that and subsequent versions.

### Enabling Feature Gates

To ensure that snapshot and clone functionality can be utilised by the CSI driver use the following commands to ensure that the correct feature gates are open in your Kubernetes deployment.

Note that most Kubernetes deployments have proprietary methods for enabling feature gates and you should check with the deployment vendor if this is the case.

In general you have to ensure that the `kubelet` process has the following switches used during the process startup:

```bash
--feature-gates=VolumeSnapshotDataSource=true,VolumePVCDataSource=true
```

**Note:** 
* `VolumePVCDataSource` gate is no longer required from Kuberenetes 1.18 (feature went GA at this version)
* `VolumeSnapshotDataSource` gate is no longer required from Kubernetes 1.17 (defaults to true from this version)

More details on feature-gate alpha and beta support can be found [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/feature-gates/#feature-gates-for-alpha-or-beta-features)

Detailed below are the methods to enable feature gates in a few common deployment tools:

#### kubespray

Edit the file `roles/kubespray-defaults/defaults/main.yaml` and add the following lines in the appropriate locations

```yaml
volume_clones: True
volume_snapshots: True

feature_gate_snap_clone:
  - "VolumeSnapshotDataSource={{ volume_snapshots | string }}"
  - "VolumePVCDataSource={{ volume_clones | string }}"
```

Update the `kube_feature_gates` parameter to enable the feature gates

```yaml
kube_feature_gates: |-
  {{ feature_gate_snap_clone }}
```

#### kubeadm

Edit your kubeadm configuration and modify the `kind` config for the cluster apiServer. An example config would be:

```yaml
kind: Cluster
apiVersion: kind.sigs.k8s.io/v1alpha3
# patch the generated kubeadm config with some extra settings
kubeadmConfigPatches:
- |
  apiVersion: kubeadm.k8s.io/v1beta2
  kind: ClusterConfiguration
  metadata:
    name: config
  apiServer:
    extraArgs:
      "feature-gates": "VolumeSnapshotDataSource=true"
```

#### kops

Edit the kops `cluster.yaml` and add the following for `kind: Cluster`:

```yaml
spec:
  kubelet:
    featureGates:
      VolumeSnapshotDataSource: "true"
      VolumePVCDataSource: "true"
```

#### OpenShift

CSI snapshot and clone support is only available from OpenShift 4.3.

To enable these features in OpenShift edit the Feature Gate Custom Resource, named `cluster`, in the `openshift-config` project. Add `VolumeSnapshotDataSource` and `VolumePVCDataSource`as enabled feature gates.

#### Docker Kubernetes Service

Install UCP with the `--storage-expt-enabled` flag. This will enable all the k8s 1.14 capable feature gates, including support for volume snapshots. 
**Note:** Volume clones are not supported in DKS due to the version of Kuberenetes deployed by Docker EE 3.0.

#### Platform9 Managed Kuberenetes

Currently the deployment GUI for PMK does not allow for changing feature-gates therefore to enable feature-gates on PMK it is first necessary to build your cluster using the Platfom9 tools and then enable the feature-gates after deployment.

Once the cluster is deployed on each of the master nodes perform the following:

Edit the file `/opt/pf9/pf9-kube/conf/masterconfig/base/master.yaml` and change the two reference of

```
        - "--feature-gates=PodPriority=true"
```

to

```
        - "--feature-gates=PodPriority=true,VolumePVCDataSource=true,VolumeSnapshotDataSource=true"
```

Once completed, reboot the master nodes in series.

### Validating Feature Gates

To validate if your feature gates have been correctly set, check the `api-server` pod in the `kube-system` namespace for one of the nodes in the cluster:

```
kubectl describe -n kube-system pod kube-api-server-<node name> | grep feature-gates
```

This should result is the following if the feature gates are correctly set.

```
 --feature-gates=VolumeSnapshotDataSource=True,VolumePVCDataSource=True
```

### Examples

Once you have correctly installed PSO on a Kubernetes deployment and the appropriate feature gates have been enabled the following examples can be used to show the use of the snapshot and clone functionality.

These examples start with the assumption that a PVC, called `pure-claim` has been created by PSO under a block related storage class, for example the `pure-block` storage class provided by the PSO installation.

#### Creating snapshots (pre-v1.17)

Use the following YAML to create a snapshot of the PVC `pure-claim`:

```yaml
apiVersion: snapshot.storage.k8s.io/v1alpha1
kind: VolumeSnapshot
metadata:
  name: volumesnapshot-1
spec:
  snapshotClassName: pure-snapshotclass
  source:
    name: pure-claim
    kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
```

#### Creating snapshots (v1.17+)

Use the following YAML to create a snapshot of the PVC `pure-claim`:

```yaml
apiVersion: snapshot.storage.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: VolumeSnapshot
metadata:
  name: volumesnapshot-1
spec:
  volumeSnapshotClassName: pure-snapshotclass
  source:
    persistentVolumeClaimName: pure-claim
```

#### Restoring a Snapshot

Use the following YAML to restore a snapshot to create a new PVC `pvc-restore-from-volumesnapshot-1`:

```yaml
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: pvc-restore-from-volumesnapshot-1
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 10Gi
  storageClassName: pure-block
  dataSource:
    kind: VolumeSnapshot
    name: volumesnapshot-1
    apiGroup: snapshot.storage.k8s.io
```

**NOTE:** Recovery of a volume snapshot to overwite its parent persistant volume is not supported in the CSI specification, however this can be achieved with a FlashArray based PVC and snapshot using the following steps:

1. Reduce application deployment replica count to zero to ensure there are no actives IOs through the PVC.
2. Log on to the FlashArray hosting the underlying PV and perform a snaphot restore through the GUI. More details can be found in the FlashArray Users Guide. This can also be achieved using the `purefa_snap` Ansible module, see [here](https://github.com/Pure-Storage-Ansible/FlashArray-Collection/blob/master/collections/ansible_collections/purestorage/flasharray/docs/purefa_snap.rst) for more details.
3. Increase the deployment replica count to 1 and allow the application to restart using the recovered PV.

#### Create a clone of a PVC

Use the following YAML to create a clone called `clone-of-pure-claim` of the PVC `pure-claim`:
**Note:** both `clone-of-pure-claim` and `pure-claim` must use the same `storageClassName`.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
    name: clone-of-pure-claim
spec:
  accessModes:
  - ReadWriteOnce
  storageClassName: pure
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 10Gi
  dataSource:
    kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
    name: pure-claim
```
To give it a try:
```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/purestorage/helm-charts/master/docs/examples/clone/pvc.yaml
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/purestorage/helm-charts/master/docs/examples/clone/clone.yaml
```
**Notes:**

1. _Application consistency:_
The snapshot API does not have any application consistency functionality. If an application-consistent snapshot is needed, the application pods need to be frozen/quiesced from an IO perspective before the snapshot is called. The application then needs to be unquiesced after the snapshot(s) has been created.
